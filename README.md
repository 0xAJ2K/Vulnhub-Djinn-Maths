# Welcome :)

> The Vulnhub box Djinn contains a maths quiz on port 1337 which if completed will give a prize. The quiz requires you to answer 1000 questions but that seemed like a lot of effort so I wrote a script for it.

```
git clone https://github.com/0xAJ2K/Vulnhub-Djinn-Maths.git
cd Vulnhub-Djinn-Maths/
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 solver.py -u <IP>
```
